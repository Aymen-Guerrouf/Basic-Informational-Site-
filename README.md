# Basic-Informational-Site-
this is a very basic informational site that contains 4 pages: index, about, contact-me and 404. I created node.js server file index.js to serve the right page according to the url.

    localhost:8080 should take users to index.html
    localhost:8080/about should take users to about.html
    localhost:8080/contact-me should take users to contact-me.html
    404.html should display any time the user tries to go to a page not listed above.
